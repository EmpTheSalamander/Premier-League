    <h1 id="heading">Are Man United Still Title Contenders?</h1>
    <img id="newspic" src="https://content.api.news/v3/images/bin/aa476eca409f32770f2f5dea340b25bd">
    <p id="text">As Manchester United lost to Sheffield, drew with Everton and drew with West Brom, it has still started to feel like the title is slowly moving out of United's reach. Man City are sitting at the top 7 pooints ahead of United with a game in hand!  Man United are somehow still clinging on to 2nd by goal difference and are tied on points with Leicester as they beat Liverpool 3-1. This season has not gone well for two teams of the big six; Arsenal and Tottenham. Tottenham are currently on 9th place and Arsenal are right behind them at 10th place. West Brom struck first against United with a goal from Mbaye Diagne in the first 86 seconds itself. United were able to find an equaliser in the 44th minute of the game via a beautiful volley by Bruno Fernandes. No team could find a goal in the second half and the game ended as a draw. I am not happy being a United fan myself but the frustration is bigger for the liverpool fans as they suffered an upsetting loss to Leicester who are now 3rd on the table. Chelsea make their way into the top four by beating Newcaslte 2-0. That's all for right now, be sure to write any comments, suggestions, anything at all in the form below. </p>
